# FaIse_Chaos Scripting Portfolio

Welcome to my ROBLOX scripting portfolio. This repository showcases my work, projects, and skills in Lua programming for the ROBLOX platform.

## About Me

In real life I am a cybersecurity student and I have started to dive into various programming languagues (Python, HTML, CSS) that aren't as relevant to what I'll be doing on ROBLOX but I still get exposed to other important skills like troubleshooting, logic, creative process, and problem solving. I have a deep love for learning, so while my skills may not be very advanced right now, I am always excited to learn something new and do better every day.

## Projects

Each project that I have listed on my portfolio will have two links - one is an internal link to this repository that includes the code for the project and the other is the link to the ROBLOX experience so you can test it out if you'd like. I will also attack the studio file in case there are things you would like to look at outside of my code.

### 1. SCP-004
- **Description:** I was assigned to create SCPs for (at the time Fox's) Rovairo's Foundation. I chose SCP-004 because it gave me some room to be creative but also had some pre-existing lore for me to stick to and follow. You spawn with various keys and each one has it's own effect when you use it to open the door (holding it in your hand while pressing E on the door). I am not a builder so the build for the SCP is very rudimentary and incomplete. This studio instance was built for compatibiltiy with the rest of the "new site". At this point I don't remember which one so if you see a bunch of extra files in there, that's what you are looking at. If you're looking for the script in roblox studio it's under ServerScriptStorage>Framework>Modules>SCPs>SCP-004. I do not believe anything else in that studio is my work.

### 2. Holistic Medicine System
- **Description:** I was assigned to create a system for scientists to gather resources and then have a crafting tree to create various elixirs and potions. There are a few different machines that each have their own script. I would suggest looking at the studio file because it's a lot to just look at the code. The comments/documentation are lacking, I worked on this before I learned the importance of having good notes in your code. My SCP-004 (my most recent project) has much better comments and you can see the improvement from this project to my most recent, SCP-004. There are a few models that aren't finished so keep that in mind. You'll need to equip the gloves and gas mask if you don't want to die while making/mixing some of these together! I really enjoyed working on this project and I learned a lot through working on it.

### 3. Geothermal Plant
- **Description:** I worked with Tagap (guy goes to school for some sort of engineering) to create a somewhat realistic geothermal power plant for our engineer and techs. It's vastly unfinished but I thought it wouldn't hurt to include. I worked on this project between Holistic Medicine and SCP-004 and I think it showcases my improvement well.
